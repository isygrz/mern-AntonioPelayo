# STEPS

1. Introduction

- Initial setup for a MERN-based e-commerce platform focused on tile sales for JaliscoTile

2. Install Tools

- Node.js & npm
- Vite (`npm create vite@latest`)
- Tailwind CSS (`npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`)
- React Router (`npm install react-router-dom`)

3. Create React App

- Project scaffolded using Vite
- Tailwind CSS initialized via `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`
- App shell created with routing (`main.jsx`, `App.jsx`)

4. Create Git Repository

- Project committed to Git for version control

5. Cleanup & Final Adjustments (project was migrated from Create React App to Vite)

- Legacy CRA-specific files were removed:
  → reportWebVitals.js, setupTests.js, App.test.js, CRA-style index.css, and default App.js boilerplate
- Unused test/config/dependency files were also purged:
  → postcss.config.js, tailwind.config.js, and package-lock.json regenerated
- Key dependencies retained and upgraded:
  → react, react-dom, react-router-dom, and Vite plugins like @vitejs/plugin-react
- Tailwind and PostCSS remain active with Vite-native support
- Scripts simplified:
  → Uses vite, vite build, and vite preview instead of react-scripts

6. Add Routing (powered by react-router-dom in App.jsx)

- BrowserRouter is used via the project’s entry point (main.jsx)
- The main routing logic lives inside App.jsx:
  → Home route / renders HomeScreen.jsx, which lists products
  → Dynamic route /product/:slug renders ProductScreen.jsx based on URL param
- Components are imported at the top:
  → import { Routes, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
- All <a> tags were replaced with <Link> to enable client-side routing
  → Example: <Link to={/product/${product.slug}}>
- This clean separation supports future scalability for cart, login, and admin routes

7. List Products

- Local `data.js` file contains mock product listings
- Display products dynamically using `map()` inside `HomeScreen.jsx`

8. Responsive Product Card Layout

- Displays a clean, interactive product tile with image, title, price, and sample button
  → product.imageGallery, product.name, product.pricePerBox, onToggleSample
- Styled with Tailwind classes for structure and clarity
  → flex flex-col, border, rounded-lg, shadow, overflow-hidden
- Image area uses aspect-[4/3] and object-cover for consistent visual height and crop
- Mobile-optimized with text-base, text-sm, and proper spacing via gap-2, p-4
- Hover effects include scale, ring, and shadow transitions
  → hover:scale-[1.02], hover:ring-2, hover:shadow-xl
- Sample toggle button updates dynamically via props and uses conditional styling
- "Stock" badge overlays image using absolute positioning with styled label

9. Add Sample to Cart Toggle

- Label (dynamic button) changes based on inSampleCart prop:
  → 'Add Sample to Cart' vs. 'Sample in Cart'
- Visual feedback provided through conditional Tailwind styling:
  → Scarlet red for active state, Periwinkle blue for default
- State updated via callback:
  → onClick={() => onToggleSample(product.slug)} delegates control to parent
- Button styling includes:
  → w-full, py-2, rounded, text-sm, font-semibold, transition-colors
- Encourages user interaction without full page reload or redirect
- Note: This approach ensures stateless, reusable UI where product sample status is lifted and managed externally (likely in Redux or component state)

10. Price Display Format

- Value rendered (JSX and Tailwind) from product.pricePerBox.toFixed(2) to ensure two decimal places
- Uses semantic HTML:
  → main price in <div className="text-sm font-slab">
  → per-unit label in nested <span className="text-xs text-slate-veil">/box</span>
- Typography sizing ensures legibility and hierarchy between value and unit
- Aligned visually with product title and button using flex-col layout

11. Image Consistency (utility-first layout rules)

- Wrapper uses aspect-[4/3] to enforce consistent width-to-height ratio across all cards
- <img> element styled with w-full h-full object-cover to fill container without distortion
- Smooth hover effect enhances UI feedback:
  → transition-transform hover:scale-105
- Container uses overflow-hidden to clip overflow and maintain clean edges
