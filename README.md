# STEPS

1. Introduction

- Initial setup for a MERN-based e-commerce platform focused on tile sales for JaliscoTile

2. Install Tools

- Node.js & npm
- Vite (`npm create vite@latest`)
- Tailwind CSS (`npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`)
- React Router (`npm install react-router-dom`)

3. Create React App

- Project scaffolded using Vite
- Tailwind CSS initialized via `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`
- App shell created with routing (`main.jsx`, `App.jsx`)

4. Create Git Repository

- Project committed to Git for version control

5. Cleanup & Final Adjustments (project was migrated from Create React App to Vite)

- Legacy CRA-specific files were removed:
  → reportWebVitals.js, setupTests.js, App.test.js, CRA-style index.css, and default App.js boilerplate
- Unused test/config/dependency files were also purged:
  → postcss.config.js, tailwind.config.js, and package-lock.json regenerated
- Key dependencies retained and upgraded:
  → react, react-dom, react-router-dom, and Vite plugins like @vitejs/plugin-react
- Tailwind and PostCSS remain active with Vite-native support
- Scripts simplified:
  → Uses vite, vite build, and vite preview instead of react-scripts

6. Add Routing (powered by react-router-dom in App.jsx)

- BrowserRouter is used via the project’s entry point (main.jsx)
- The main routing logic lives inside App.jsx:
  → Home route / renders HomeScreen.jsx, which lists products
  → Dynamic route /product/:slug renders ProductScreen.jsx based on URL param
- Components are imported at the top:
  → import { Routes, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
- All <a> tags were replaced with <Link> to enable client-side routing
  → Example: <Link to={/product/${product.slug}}>
- This clean separation supports future scalability for cart, login, and admin routes

7. List Products

- Local `data.js` file contains mock product listings
- Display products dynamically using `map()` inside `HomeScreen.jsx`

8. Responsive Product Card Layout

- Displays a clean, interactive product tile with image, title, price, and sample button
  → product.imageGallery, product.name, product.pricePerBox, onToggleSample
- Styled with Tailwind classes for structure and clarity
  → flex flex-col, border, rounded-lg, shadow, overflow-hidden
- Image area uses aspect-[4/3] and object-cover for consistent visual height and crop
- Mobile-optimized with text-base, text-sm, and proper spacing via gap-2, p-4
- Hover effects include scale, ring, and shadow transitions
  → hover:scale-[1.02], hover:ring-2, hover:shadow-xl
- Sample toggle button updates dynamically via props and uses conditional styling
- "Stock" badge overlays image using absolute positioning with styled label

9. Add Sample to Cart Toggle

- Label (dynamic button) changes based on inSampleCart prop:
  → 'Add Sample to Cart' vs. 'Sample in Cart'
- Visual feedback provided through conditional Tailwind styling:
  → Scarlet red for active state, Periwinkle blue for default
- State updated via callback:
  → onClick={() => onToggleSample(product.slug)} delegates control to parent
- Button styling includes:
  → w-full, py-2, rounded, text-sm, font-semibold, transition-colors
- Encourages user interaction without full page reload or redirect
- Note: This approach ensures stateless, reusable UI where product sample status is lifted and managed externally (likely in Redux or component state)

10. Price Display Format

- Value rendered (JSX and Tailwind) from product.pricePerBox.toFixed(2) to ensure two decimal places
- Uses semantic HTML:
  → main price in <div className="text-sm font-slab">
  → per-unit label in nested <span className="text-xs text-slate-veil">/box</span>
- Typography sizing ensures legibility and hierarchy between value and unit
- Aligned visually with product title and button using flex-col layout

11. Image Consistency (utility-first layout rules)

- Wrapper uses aspect-[4/3] to enforce consistent width-to-height ratio across all cards
- <img> element styled with w-full h-full object-cover to fill container without distortion
- Smooth hover effect enhances UI feedback:
  → transition-transform hover:scale-105
- Container uses overflow-hidden to clip overflow and maintain clean edges

12. React 18 Migration & Redux Toolkit Preparation

- As part of stabilizing the development environment and aligning with Redux Toolkit best practices, we performed the following adjustments:
  → downgraded React 19 → React 18
  → locked versions to stable React 18 releases: "react": "18.2.0"; "react-dom": "18.2.0"; "react-router-dom": "6.23.1"

13. Product Feature Refactor (Redux + Routing)

- Refactored product rendering to use Redux Toolkit rather than static data import. Slug-based dynamic routing is preserved, UI is untouched.
  → replaced `data.js` usage in `HomeScreen` and `ProductScreen` with `productSlice` Redux state
  → used `useSelector()` to retrieve product array from store
  → preserved all sample toggle logic, styling, and routing with `<Link to={`/product/${slug}`}>`
- Files Modified
  → `src/screens/HomeScreen.jsx` — product data now pulled from Redux store
  → `src/screens/ProductScreen.jsx` — uses Redux to fetch product by slug
  → `src/components/ProductCard.jsx` — no changes needed
- Products will later be connected to backend API calls.

14. CMS Foundation (Phase 1)

- Implemented `<AdminLayout />` with nested routing
- Built admin dashboard accessible at `/admin`
- Sidebar routes: `/admin/heroes`, `/admin/blogs`, `/admin/badges`, `/admin/settings`

15. Hero Section Manager (Phase 2)

- Visual section CRUD interface (title, subtitle, image, CTA, placement)
- Hero rendering on `/` via `SectionRenderer`
- Modular structure with:
  → `HeroManager.jsx`, `SectionEditor.jsx`, `ImagePicker.jsx`

16. Blog Manager (Phase 3)

- Admin blog editor using `react-quill` (WYSIWYG)
- Fields: title, slug, image, content
- Data synced with `blogData.js`
- Public blog viewer:
  → `/blog` → blog list
  → `/blog/:slug` → blog post

17. Badge Manager (Phase 4)

- Create/edit badge labels and colors (stored in `badgeData.js`)
- Live color previews via color picker
- Future integration: product tags, banners, promos

18. Cart System (Redux Toolkit)

- Full cart state managed with `cartSlice.js`
- Cart page `/cart`: update qty, remove item, subtotal, CTA
- Add-to-cart button on `/product/:slug`

19. Product Manager

- Admin CRUD UI for products with:
  → Image, name, description, price, badge
- Connected to `data.js` for product list display
- Uses `ImageUploader` component for previews

20. Homepage CMS SectionRenderer

- `SectionRenderer.jsx` renders all CMS-defined sections by:
  → `isActive`, `placement`, and `order`
- Supported visual types: `hero`, `promogrid`, `blogpreview`
- Integrates into `/` via `HomeScreen.jsx`

21. CMS Layout Editor (SettingsManager)

- Add/reorder/disable visual sections across routes
- Section types: hero, promoGrid, blogPreview
- Component tree:
  → `SettingsManager.jsx`
  → `SectionRow.jsx`

22. Image Uploader Utility

- Used in product/blog/hero editors
- Preview image or enter remote URL
- Emits base64 or path to parent component

23. Key Routes
    | Route | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | `/` | Homepage with CMS-rendered visual sections + product grid |
    | `/product/:slug` | Product detail + add-to-cart |
    | `/cart` | Cart screen with Redux integration |
    | `/blog`, `/blog/:slug` | Public blog list + post viewer |
    | `/admin` | Admin dashboard layout |
    | `/admin/heroes` | Hero visual section manager |
    | `/admin/blogs` | Blog CMS manager |
    | `/admin/badges` | Badge CRUD interface |
    | `/admin/products` | Product CRUD interface |
    | `/admin/settings` | Homepage visual section configurator |

> Built to scale: All admin features are backend-ready with state and structure prepared for database integration.
